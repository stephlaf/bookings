This is a simple no-styling-at-all Rails app, put up to implement the [flatpickr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flatpickr) package, and add some logic to disable the unavailable dates from a booking calendar.

It was created for the benefit of our students here at [Le Wagon Montreal](https://www.lewagon.com/montreal), to help them if they wish to implement such a feature in their AirBnB clones.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
